# COMP 488 Assignment 2: Simple Website Deployment

## üìã Project Description

This project is a responsive website created for COMP 488 Assignment 2, demonstrating fundamental web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website features a modern, clean design with interactive elements and is fully optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing experiences.

The site includes three main content sections: project information, interactive features demonstration, and a showcase of technologies used. The interactive element allows users to toggle hidden content visibility through a JavaScript-powered button that dynamically changes its appearance and text.

## üåê Live Demo

**Deployed Site:** [https://comp488-vercel-app.vercel.app/](https://comp488-vercel-app.vercel.app/)

## üöÄ Local Development

To run this project locally on your machine:

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- A text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, or similar)

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yaredabebel/comp488-vercel-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd comp488-vercel-app
   ```

3. Open the project:
   - **Option 1:** Double-click `index.html` to open in your default browser
   - **Option 2:** Right-click `index.html` ‚Üí "Open with" ‚Üí Choose your preferred browser
   - **Option 3:** Use a local server (recommended for development):
     ```bash
     # If you have Python installed:
     python -m http.server 8000
     # Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
     ```

4. That's it! The website should now be running locally.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup and document structure
- **CSS3** - Styling, responsive design, and animations
- **JavaScript** - Interactive functionality and DOM manipulation
- **Git** - Version control
- **GitHub** - Repository hosting
- **Vercel** - Deployment and hosting platform

## üìö Learning Reflection

Working on this project provided valuable hands-on experience with the complete web development workflow, from initial coding to deployment. One of the most significant learning outcomes was understanding how the three core web technologies work together harmoniously - HTML providing the structural foundation, CSS creating the visual presentation, and JavaScript adding interactive functionality. The process of separating concerns into different files also reinforced best practices in web development organization.

The deployment process using Git, GitHub, and Vercel was particularly enlightening. Initially, the concept of version control seemed complex, but working through the actual process of committing changes, pushing to GitHub, and seeing those changes automatically reflected on the live Vercel site was quite satisfying. This workflow demonstrated the power of modern development tools and how they enable seamless collaboration and deployment.

The most challenging aspect was ensuring responsive design across different device sizes while maintaining the visual appeal and functionality. CSS Grid and Flexbox proved invaluable for creating layouts that adapt gracefully to various screen sizes. Additionally, debugging JavaScript interactions required careful attention to DOM manipulation and event handling, which deepened my understanding of how browsers interpret and execute code.
